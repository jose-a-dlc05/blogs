Today I learned about how JavaScript executes code in the most simple way. Shout out to Frontend Masters for JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2. 

I'll go over the three topics that I learned:
- Thread of Execution
- Memory
- Call Stack

In the simplest way possible, JavaScript does two things:
1) It goes through code line by line sequentially
2) It saves things through memory

Here's what I mean. How would JavaScript execute the following:

const num = 2;
function doubleNumber(number) {
    return num * num;
}
const result = doubleNumber(num);
const secondResult = doubleNumber(5);

Let's go through this by order:

Define:
- Execution Context
